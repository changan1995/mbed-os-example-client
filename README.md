My destination for this project is to upload accelerometer and magnetometer data into a IOT cloud, either bluemix or onenet is ok.

#1 reading the accel & magent data from the board and express it through js 
	1.1 read the FXOS8700CQ Driver Code 
	p9 in the document.whether this is written in mbed OS? dont know.check the functions and classes in it.

#2 replace the js form with cloud

#3 make a course about it.
